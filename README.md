# pci

Contract-only snapshot of the Shuyra PCI declarations and public protocol, plus
the three existing pure protocol tests.

This repository is the public PCI provider prerequisite for later Kernel and
Source consumers. It is **not** a standalone PCI Driver Unit, server, runtime,
image build, or composition catalog. It contains no hardware access, no loader,
no Unit runtime, and no `prog-pci` image target. Source (`programs`,
`crates/composition`) still owns the driver body and the actual `prog-pci`
image target until the full driver migration.

The Kernel-owned DMA-confirmation tests genuinely need the real PCI API and
declaration when their Source phase moves to public packages. That partial
closure is why this provider exists; it is not a claim that the PCI Driver Unit
has moved.

## Layout

- `declaration/` — `pci-declaration` 0.1.0. The one `UnitFile` declaration
  (`PROGRAM`, name `pci`), the ECAM/aperture supply bindings, and marks.
- `api/` — `pci-api` 0.1.0. `Place`, `Toggle`, `Said`, `Wire`, `Call`, the
  generated `Fail` code table, and the entry/back/BAR marks and action codes.
  API sibling paths such as `../declaration` stay inside this provider.
- `api/tests/protocol.rs` — the three existing Source tests, byte-identical:
  request/reply golden bytes and bounds, malformed strictness, and
  back-token/mark/fail-code checks.

Each ordinary data type remains in its own file. No production Rust file was
refactored, renamed, reformatted, visibility-widened, or given a new facade.

## Contract preserved

`PLACE`, `ENABLE`, `DISABLE`, and `RELEASE` keep their existing effect
meaning: placement opens memory space only; enable/disable MASTER is separate;
release removes the placement. The messages carry no trusted caller field —
sender identity is supplied by the real Kernel, never by the new caller. The
retained golden sizes are `Place` 22 encoded / 24 buffer, `Toggle` 21 encoded /
24 buffer, `Said` 13 encoded / 16 buffer. Messages are not padded to buffer
capacity.

The host cases exercise data types and wire bytes only. They do not prove
Kernel sender authentication, hardware effects, or driver lifetime behavior;
those remain in Source/Kernel tests until their own phases.

There is no PCI-to-IOMMU dependency. The two providers can be published in
either order.

## Build and test

```sh
cargo build --locked --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --lib
cargo build --locked --target riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf --lib
cargo build --locked --release --target riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf --lib
cargo test -p pci-api --locked --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

Add `--offline` after the dependency cache is prepared. The API packages set
`test = false` on the library, so the three cases execute through the
integration test target, not as library unit tests.

The test target's direct dependencies are `env`, `wire`, `pci-api`, and
`pci-declaration` — a subset of the production closure. The full 13-package
provider closure is 2 local packages plus `env`, `unit`, `system-api`, `wire`,
`mold`, `bitflags`, `erra`, `proc-macro2`, `quote`, `syn`, and `unicode-ident`;
there are no test-only external dependencies.

## Provenance and license

See `PROVENANCE.md` for the frozen Source commit, authors, old-to-new file
hashes, test mapping, and exact limits. Source had no tracked license or
manifest license/authors field; this snapshot adds none and asserts no
copyright permission.
